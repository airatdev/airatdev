Hi there, I'm Airat ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒŸ _As of **September 2023**, I am looking for a new team_ ðŸŒŸ

[**Up-to-date Resume in PDF**](https://airat.sh/assets/Airat%20Shigapov%20CV.pdf)

I've been building software for over a decade, with the last couple of years leading engineering efforts in a pre-seed startup team. While a significant chunk of my experience comes from the **Ruby** (and naturally, Rails) world, I'm not limited by it and am open to diving into new tech stacks given some ramp-up time. I have done it before.

I'm targeting a senior/staff-level developer roles in backend as I miss hands-on work, but also still open to continuing exploring the engineering management track. I am looking for a magical combination of a friendly atmosphere, healthy work-life balance, and efficient async-first processes. I donâ€™t have strong preferences on things like company size, tech stack and business domain (so long itâ€™s not morally questionable).

Preference for fully remote global positions or hybrid roles in the Netherlands. Ideally within a humane distance from The Hague where I live with my family.

I am ready to jump in immediately.

ðŸ’Œ If I sound like a match or if you know a place where I might fit, please reach me out via email at **[hi@airat.sh](mailto:hi@airat.sh)**, or @airatdev on most platforms.

Cheers!
